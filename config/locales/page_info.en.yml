      <h2>Get Started in Deterlab</h2>

      <p>
        To start using DeterLab, you need to apply for a user account using a web form that you can start just below.
        But first, please read our Usage Guide to the basic concepts of DeterLab usage - <a href="http://info.deterlab.net/get_started_deterlab">Get Started in DeterLab</a> -
        which will help you identify which type of DeterLab access you should apply for.
        Also please read the <a href="https://trac.deterlab.net/wiki/Policy">DeterLab Usage Policy</a> to ensure
        that your plans match the appropriate uses of DeterLab. Then when you're ready click "Next" button below
        and you'll be guided through the application process.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>If you already have a DeterLab account,</b> please do not use this form. 
        Instead, please login <a href="/#loginB">here</a> and then choose from the options for requesting additional access.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that your application requires an organization-affiliated email address, for DeterLab staff to
        be able to contact you to conclude the application process. Other email addresses (Gmail, Hotmail, email addresses from ISPs) will not be accepted.
      </p>
